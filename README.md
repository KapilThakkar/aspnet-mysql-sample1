# ASP.NET 4.5 and MySQL Sample Application
This is MySQL Example Application which demonstrate connectivity between ASP.NET 4.5 and MySQL on OpenShift 3 Cloud.

## How to run this sample on OpenShift 3

1) To run this sample application on OpenShift 3 Environment, deploy Click2Cloud's ASP.NET Templates on OpenShift 3 environment as specified instructions at https://github.com/Click2Cloud/DotNetOnOpenShift3.

Once ASP.NET Templates availble in OpenShift Web Console, create application using `aspnet-45-mysql-ex` template and provide this as a source repository url. 

2) Once application comes in running state, its time to update `connectionstring` in `Web.config` file. Based on `mysql` pod created in OpenShift update `DefaultConnection` in `Web.config` file. 

##### NOTE: Use `mysql` pod `Cluster IP` as a `server` value in connection string and commit changes in GitHub.

3) Now create table with dummy records in MySQL Pod running in OpenShift. Connect to MySQL Database using Port Forwarding and run `CreateTable.sql` script under `DatabaseScript` folder to create table and insert dummy records.

Now rebuild application.
